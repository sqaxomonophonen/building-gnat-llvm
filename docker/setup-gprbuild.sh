# XXX debian does come with a gprbuild, however it doesn't seem to work
# properly; in particular it appears to ignore the statement in gnat_llvm.gpr
# that says (and probably also the one adjacent to it):
#    for Executable ("gcc_wrapper.adb") use "llvm-gcc";
# Instead it tries to compile with gcc-12.

# One weird thing though: the new gprbuild says v18 and copyright 2004-2016,
# and so does the debian-provided version? Github has a v25 release... not sure
# what's going on, but the gprbuild we build here fixes the problem mentioned
# above

# XXX here we undoing apt-get install gprbuild from earlier; I can't remove it
# right now because it would invalidate 3Â½ hours worth of caching... I can't
# even add a comment about it without invalidating the cache :)
