The patches below `llvm16-patches/` are the same as in `llvm/patches/` in
`gnat-llvm.git`, except they've been "normalized" (the originals had an
inconsistent root dir) and renamed to fit the conventions of the FreeBSD Ports
collection ("patch-" prefix added). They must be copied to
`/usr/ports/devel/llvm16/files/` before building llvm16 in
`/usr/ports/devel/llvm16`

Install gnat12 and add it to your PATH before compiling gnat-llvm:
$ pkg install gnat12
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/gnat12/bin

`gnat-llvm.patch` must also be applied before compiling gnat-llvm. The changes
are discussed in the parent README.

Also see the build instructions in gnat-llvm.git:README, but:
 - Use the llvm16 build instructions here
 - Use `gmake` instead of `make` to build
